            Black Jack is a pretty simple game, on the **deal** we both draw two cards (my second one is *hidden* however). Your goal is to stay below **21** but as close as possible.

            You can either **hit** (`!%s hit`) to get a new card or **stand** (`!%s stand`) if you don't want to draw a new card.

            After that I will draw my cards until I reach at least **17** points. Whoever has the highest score wins.

            If you hit a **10** and an **Ace** on the deal that's a **Black Jack** and you win immediately.

            Card Values:
            **Numbers**: Their **number**
            **Jack**, **Queen** and **King**: **10**
            **Ace**: **1** or **11**
